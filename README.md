Under-graduate student mini project for Machine learning class.

the dataset name is not accurate consider its content. The last record in the dataset was in 30 May, 2023.
I use SARIMAX model for this mini project as it is a short-period currency rate prediction. In order to predict for more advance prediction, I would recommend you to use Long Short-Term Memory(LSTM).
all of the graphs might not be able to be shown in the preview, you should consider to run it on your local machine or any cloud platform.
